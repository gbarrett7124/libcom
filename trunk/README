At present, this code is incomplete; the code is being extracted from
an old project and cleaned up in stages. In hindsight, it might have
been quicker to re-write the whole thing from scratch. Any out-of-process
stuff will be freshly written; the XPCOM bridge is new, the Win32 COM/registry
bridge will is old but needs some tweaking before it's committed, the
Mac-specific bits were only ever experimental so are getting some heavy
treatment first.

libcom started life a long time ago and has been lying around getting dusty
for quite a while now. Hopefully the benefit of hindsight and the need to
rework chunks of it will let me turn it into something that's useful
to people.
