This is a modified version of 'widl', the WINE IDL compiler. The only
real changes are slight tweaks to the outputted code, and an option
to omit the boilerplate output.

WINE, and hence widl, is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License,
but is not distributed directly with libcom (which is distributed under a
"new BSD"-style license). idlc is not required to build or use libcom, but
you'll probably want it if you're going to start hacking around with libcom's
internals. You can technically get away without it, but it's easier just to
have it.

If you're just using libcom, you definitely don't need this. The intent is
that code generated by any of idlc, widl, midl and xpidl should be useable
with libcom.

One day, libcom may get its own IDL compiler (one which doesn't require
bits of the Windows headers in order to be compiled), but it's not a
priority. Contributions are, of course, welcome--licenses permitting.
